### Introduction

This is a recipe recommendation mobile app which utilizes object recognition with the aim of assisting cooks at home in determining what to cook given their available ingredients. Several Firebase services were employed for user authentication and storage, alongside Teachable Machine for object recognition. The backend is a separate Node.js application hosted on a Raspberry Pi which enables the app to be accessed from anywhere.

- Firebase API key file has been removed from this project.
